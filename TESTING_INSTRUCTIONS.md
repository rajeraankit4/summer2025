# Testing Instructions for Double-Click Fix

## Expected Behavior

With the latest changes, the "Continue to Documents" button should:

1. ✅ Work on the **first click** (no double-click required)
2. ✅ Save **only one entry** to the database
3. ✅ Show loading state ("Saving...") while processing
4. ✅ Navigate to the Document Upload page (Step 3)
5. ✅ Display success message

## Debug Console Logs

When testing, check the browser console for these logs:

- "handleNext called, isSubmitting: false"
- "Starting submission process"
- "Form validation passed, saving data"
- "Data saved, updating parent and navigating"

## Changes Made

1. **Added Event Prevention**: `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent any form submission conflicts
2. **Enhanced Loading State**: Proper `isSubmitting` state management
3. **Added Timeout**: 100ms delay between data update and navigation to ensure state synchronization
4. **Debugging**: Console logs to track the submission process

## SignupFlow Debugging

Also check for these logs from the SignupFlow component:

- "updateSignupData called with: {data}"
- "nextStep called, currentStep: 2"
- "Advancing to step: 3"

## If Still Having Issues

1. Check if form validation is failing
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. Check network tab for API call success
4. Look for any console errors

## Test Steps

1. Fill out all required fields in the Personal Details form
2. Click "Continue to Documents" button ONCE
3. Button should show "Saving..." state
4. Success message should appear
5. Should navigate to Document Upload page
6. Check database for single entry (not duplicate)

## Remove Debug Logs

Once confirmed working, remove console.log statements from:

- `handleNext` function in PersonalDetails.jsx
- `updateSignupData` function in SignupFlow.jsx
- `nextStep` function in SignupFlow.jsx
